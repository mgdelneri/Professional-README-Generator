## Description

### What?
This app allows the user to customize their own disco ball, by choosing from a list of specifications. 

### Why?
I believe that disco balls add a magical mood to any party, concert, or event. This app helps in customizing the user's own disco ball, which is not something you find very often. 

### How?
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. I also used the DiscoBallsForAll API, which connects the user with third-party disco ball vendors. 

### Significance
My project stands out because of its ease of usage and the fact that it consolidates all of the steps of customizing and ordering disco balls online. 

### Lessons Learned
In working in this project, I learned the value of collaborating, both for techincal issues as well as on the creative level. 

## Installation
To install this app, the user must use a Mac OS, Windows, or Linux computer. They must also have a reliable web browser, such as Google Chrome. 

## Usage 
To use the Disco Ball Generator, the user must navigate to www.discoballgenerator.com. There, they will be shown an introduction page, with several images of already-created disco balls and a short and concise paragraph explaining what the website does. They will then click on START and be given instructions on how to use the webpage as well as a series of prompts, giving them choices for they styling of their disco ball. They may save their choices at any point, even if not finished. They can also look at a mock-up image of their disco ball at any point. Once finished, they can order their disco ball from any of the available vendors listed.
